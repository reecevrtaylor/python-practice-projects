# Python Practice Projects

A collection of more focused projects and exercises created to rebuild my Python proficiency.

The guiding principle of this repository is **learning through deliberate practice**. All code is written and reasoned about manually, without relying on AI assistants or code-generation tools... apart from this README...

## Goals

- Re-establish confidence in core Python syntax and idioms  
- Practice writing clean, robust, and fully understood code  
- Strengthen problem solving skills without automated shortcuts  
- Build a library of progressively more challenging exercises  
- Develop habits that support long term fluency

## Structure

Each project or exercise lives in its own directory and aims to reinforce more foundational skills, such as:

- Type safety and parsing  
- Comprehensions and iteration patterns  
- Data cleaning and validation  
- Functional design and decomposition  
- Error handling and defensive programming  
- Working with nested data structures
- Testing and verification
- Writing idiomatic, Pythonic solutions

## Using AI for Scenario Generation

AI can be used as a prompt generator rather than a code generator.  
The idea is to request realistic, domain-specific problems **without** receiving implementation details.

A typical prompt might be:

> “Create a small real-world scenario and requirements for a Python exercise.  
> Do not provide any code. Only describe the context, constraints, data shapes, and expected outputs.”

## Philosophy

The exercises are meant to simulate more real world scenarios instead of just leetcoding away.

The goal is not only to solve tasks, but to understand *why* each solution works and to strengthen intuition through repetition and reflection. Like the gym!
